# Recursive Naive Bayesian algorithm 

** Description **
This Python project uses recursive Naive Bayesian algorithm to classify 10 unknown objects as birds or airplanes

** Package Information **
1. scipy.stats norm: This package allowed us to perform normal distribution and obtain likelihood plots for acceleration and displacement features.

2. sklearn Classification report: This package allowed us to print classification reports for all features. 

*** Running the Python script ***

1. The user should open the NBC.py and run the code

2. The user will be prompted to select one of the three features: 

     1. velocity   2. velocity and acceleration  3. velocity, acceleration, displacement 

Note: I added option 3 to test my experimental part. 

3. The code will run and proceed and will produce useful statistics and plots.
