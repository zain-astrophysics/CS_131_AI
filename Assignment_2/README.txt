# Informed search algorithm 

** Description **
This Python project uses informed search algorithms to order 10 disordered pancakes

** Package Information **
1. random: This package allowed us to randomize the 10 pancakes and test the performance of each algorithm
the random.seed(42) is executed so that we obtain same random sequence for all the algorithms.

2. time: The time package allowed us to estimate the total time it takes to order the pancakes

*** Running the Python script ***

1. The user should open the informed_search.py and run the code

2. The user will be prompted to select one of the three choices: 

     1. A*   2. UCS  3. Chebyshev 

Note: I added option 3 to test my experimental part. 

3. The code will run and proceed and will produce useful statistics.
