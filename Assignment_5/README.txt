# Artificial Neural Network 

** Description **
This Python project uses ANN (Artificial Neural Network) to classify Iris plant species by using petal and sepal as input features.

** Package Information **
1. train_test_split: This package allowed us to split data into train, validation and test set

2. numpy and pandas: These packages allowed us to create matrices and compute statistical results 

*** Running the Python script ***

1. The user should open the ANN.py and run the code

2. The user will be prompted twice: 

	Prompt one:  1. Basic Experiment (ReLU)   2. Extra Experiment (Sigmoid)
	Prompt two: Would you like to perform manual query; Yes or No: 

3. The code will run and proceed and will produce useful statistics and plots.
